# MicroJava Compiler

## Introduction

**MicroJava** is a *high-level programming language*.
As the name suggests, **MicroJava** is *similar* to **Java** (which you are, probably, already familiar with), but it's *simpler*.
Similarly to Java, MicroJava source files are compiled to **bytecode**, which is then executed by a **virtual machine** (it's called  **MicroJava Virtual Machine**). MicroJava VM is a simple *interpretative emulator* (i.e. it does not have any support for some "fancy" techniques such as, e.g., *Just-In-Time compilation*).

## Main language features

* A MicoJava program is a single text file (conventionally, the extension `.mj` is used).
  It always starts with the keyword `program`.
* The main method of a MicroJava program is always called `main`.
  When MicroJava program is executed, this method is called first (i.e. it's the program's entry point).
* There are:
  * Value/primitive types (`int`, `char` and `bool`) and reference/structured types (one-dimensional arrays and user-defined classes)
  * Integer, character and boolean constants
  * Global, local and class variables (i.e. fields)
  * Global (static) and class functions (i.e. methods).
    There are no constructors
* Every class can inherit from some other class, except from itself.
  MicroJava is a single‐inheritance language.
* Inheritance in MicroJava has the *same* principles as in Java.
  Object is an instance of its class and, at the same time, all superclasses of its class.
  The subclass reference can be assigned to any of its superclass references.
  The act of converting a subclass reference into a superclass reference is called up-casting.
* Superclass methods can be **overridden** in its subclass.
  Because of that, method binding occurs at run-time, based on the type of the object.
  This is **polymorphism** (also called dynamic binding or late binding or run‐time binding) and it is a key principle of OOP.
* Within a method, the name of a field refers to the current object's field, assuming that the field isn't hidden by a method parameter.
  If it is hidden, we can access it through `this.<field-name>`.
  In the body of a method, `this` represents reference to the object whose method has been invoked.
* Method overloading is not supported in MicroJava.
* There is no `Object` class, the top‐most class, the class from which all other classes are implicitly derived.
* There is no garbage collector (allocated objects are only deallocated when the program ends).
* Predeclared static methods are `ord` (converts `char` to `int`), `chr` (converts `int` to `char`) and `len` (returns array's length).

MicroJava's single line comment starts with two forward slashes with no white spaces (`//`) and lasts till the end of line.
